# Wolf Pack Conspiracy Theories

Where would we be if we had not challenged the "truth" of other human beings, would we have come this far. I dont't believe that we would've. I have created a page where users can come and have fun. No matter who you are every person has at least one conspiracy theory that they find to be intriguing at the very least. At The Wolf Pack you can log in and post your theory, then you and other users can post evidence to try and cement that theory. I hope everyone enjoys using this app as much as I had making it and I can't wait to add more to it in the future.
